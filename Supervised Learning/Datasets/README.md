## Dataset Introduction
### USA Housing Dataset
The data USA_Housing retrived from kaggle contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
'Price': Price that the house sold at
'Address': Address for the house


### Fashion MNIST dataset
The data USA_Housing retrived from https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

### Cancer Detection Dataset
The data USA_Housing retrieved from kaggle contains the following columns:
diagnosis: B(Benign) M (Malicious)
radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean
